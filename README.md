This is a project I use to learn and experiment Vulkan.

The code might be very rough at some places, but overall I'd say, I don't bother with OOP, and while learning/exploring, I write very procedural code with minimal indirection, only factoring out things that repeat often, like buffer creation.

## Third party headers & libs
- ```SDL2```: cross platform Windowing & swapchain abstraction
- ```glm```: GLSL aligment compatible math types & functions
- ```imgui```: for future debug GUI
- ```stb_image```: single header lib for image (texture) loading
- ```tinyobjloader```: .obj 3D assets loading
- ```vma``` : Vulkan Memory Allocator by GPUOpen
- ```vkb``` : Instance, device, swapchain create (this dependency will soon be dropped)
