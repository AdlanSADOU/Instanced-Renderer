# Vulkan Renderer

This is my main side project to learn about modern GPUs, how 3D Rendering works and acquire a working knowlegde of a new powerful graphics API, namely Vulkan.

Please keep in mind that this is work in progress.
Thus, code structure will change frequently and new functionnality will be added as I learn.

## Third party headers & libs
- ```SDL2```: cross platform Windowing & swapchain abstraction
- ```glm```: GLSL aligment compatible math types & functions
- ```imgui```: for future debug GUI
- ```stb_image```: single header lib for image (texture) loading
- ```tinyobjloader```: .obj 3D assets loading
- ```vma``` : Vulkan Memory Allocator by GPUOpen
