# Vulkan_Renderer

This is my main side project to learn about modern GPUs, how 3D Rendering works and acquire a working knowlegde of a new powerful graphics API, namely Vulkan.

Please keep in mind that this is work in progress.
Thus, code structure will change frequently and new functionnality will be added as I learn.
