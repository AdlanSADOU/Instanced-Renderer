# Vulkan_Renderer

This is my main side project as a CS student to learn how modern GPUs work and acquire a working knowlegde of a new powerful graphics API, namely Vulkan.

Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress, thus the current code structure does not represent the final view.
I will refactor the code base on each milestone.
