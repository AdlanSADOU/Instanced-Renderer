This project is still under heavy development and in pre alpha stage. I'm still working on & exploring techniques, thus the API is not yet fleshed out.
So pretty big changes and refactorings are to come.

## Features

- Instanced rendering
- Array of textures: indexed inside fragment shader per primitive instance
- compute dispatch

**Result**: a 2D renderer able to render more than 2 million sprites at high framerates (60+ fps) on relatively modern GPUs with only 1 draw call
