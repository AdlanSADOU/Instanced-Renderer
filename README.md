This project is still under heavy development and in early stage, even though almost all critical rendering features are there.
Nothing has been cristallized yet. So pretty big changes and refactorings are to come.

--- 

## Features
- Instanced quad rendering
- Array of textures (indexed inside fragment shader) => many textures with only one binding
- Individual quad transforms via per instance attributes

**Result**: a 2D renderer able to render more than 2 million sprites at high framerates (60+ fps) on relatively modern GPUs with only 1 draw call

**Next feature**: Moving transform updates from CPU to GPU via compute shaders
